# Progress

## Current session
Session 2 plus review fixes (built, waiting for Louis to test on the Mac).
Session 1 is built but also still needs testing on the Mac.

## What works
- Godot 4.7 project (Forward+), opens with `scenes/main.tscn` as the main scene.
- Flat sandy test area with 8 coloured boxes to ride around.
- A simple bicycle with a rider and an orange delivery box, made from basic shapes.
- Controls (set in Project > Project Settings > Input Map):
  - W / Up arrow: pedal
  - S / Down arrow: brake, then roll slowly backwards
  - A / D or Left / Right: steer (only works while moving)
  - Space: handbrake
- Top speed 25 km/h. Riding into a box stops you; glancing hits slow you a little.
- Camera follows from behind and above, smoothly (physics interpolation is on).
- All tuning numbers are in `scripts/game_config.gd`.
- Tested headless with Godot 4.7.2: no script errors, the bike speeds up, steers,
  stops, and can't go through boxes.

### Session 2
- Gentler start: you speed up fastest from a standstill and ease off near top speed.
- Hold Shift while pedalling to sprint up to 32 km/h. Sprinting drains the stamina bar
  (about 4.5 seconds from full). Pedalling normally refills it slowly, coasting refills it fast.
- If stamina runs out the bar turns orange and you can't sprint until it's back to 25%.
- The rider leans into turns (up to 14 degrees at full speed).
- Hitting a box gives a camera shake; harder hits shake more.
- Bottom-right panel shows speed in km/h and the stamina bar (`ui/hud.tscn`).
- Tested headless: sprint reaches 32 km/h, stamina drains and refills, lean and bumps work.

### Review fixes (after Session 2)
- PRD tidied: one rating window (last 50), meters have green/orange/red bands and a
  time target, star formula written down, Heat renamed Freshness, XP builds a Rider
  Level for gear, acceptance rate rule, first big crash is free, insurance starts on,
  controls table, vision sections marked NOT NOW.
- BUILD_PLAN reordered: delivery loop (Session 3) now comes before the Palm Grove map,
  the map is split into three sessions and built from a data list, obstacles come
  after the meters, menu/saving and sound/music are separate sessions. 17 sessions.
- Esc pauses and resumes (`ui/pause_menu.tscn`), with Resume and Quit buttons.
- R puts the bike back at the start. Falling off the world also puts it back.
- Invisible walls around the edge of the test area, so you can't ride off it.
- Base screen size 1920x1080 with scaling, so the panels look the same on any screen.
- The wheels now spin with the bike's speed.
- A smoke test in `tests/smoke_test.gd` rides the bike headless and checks it moves,
  sprints, drains stamina and brakes. Command is in CLAUDE.md.
- The HUD script was attached twice (scene + main); now only in the HUD scene.

## Known bugs
- None found yet. Not tested on a real screen yet.
- The review fixes and the smoke test were written without Godot available, so the
  first run on the Mac is the real check. If the smoke test prints an error, paste it in.

## Next
- Louis tests Sessions 1 and 2 (plus the review fixes) with the checklists in BUILD_PLAN.md.
- Then Session 3: one full delivery on the test area.
